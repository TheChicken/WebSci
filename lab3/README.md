Lab 3 - Git & Bugs

I have never been that great at GitHub - I dont think I understand the differences in branches and I keep updating things to the origin/master. I was able to set up my repository fairly easily through the GitHub Desktop GUI which I really enjoy using. Adding both of you was a simple task I perfomred on github.com

The second part however, was a little challenging becuase I still dont know much of what was going on. I know Carson was taking care of setting up the server and he gave us instructions on how to add the repo through git bash which were really easy to follow! I was able to very easily set up the connection. However.. I am still not sure on how to push and will have to clarify this with my team members who have more experience than I do. 

As far as the server link - I know we are having an issue with bugzilla and a module that will not load. Therefore the link is not active. I dont know how to help so I unfortunately cannot give the link to part 2 at this time. I will update the lab once the link is active :/
