Lab 6 - ETL

Q: Where would it be better to place the CSV conversion code, in the node server or in an Angular controller? Why?

A: In my humble opinion I beliee that the CSV conversion code is better placed on the server side. A heavy computation such as this should be completed on the server side in order to preserve speed processing. 

This lab was a pain in the butt at times but was also a really fun exercise. Building off of Lab 5 helped with the underlying logic and provided a great starting point since most of the underlying work was previously laid. I was able to do a little more formatting to the tweets this time around as I (try) to understand bootstrap a little better. I really enjoyed using the buttons and like the way that Anuglar makes such easily responsive forms and buttons.
